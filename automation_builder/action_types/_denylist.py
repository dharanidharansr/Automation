"""Shared denylist of sensitive DocTypes that automation actions must NEVER target.

Automations run with ignore_permissions=True as a deliberate tradeoff (the
automation engine acts on behalf of the configuring user, not the running
user). However, certain core DocTypes must never be mutated by automation
actions — targeting them would allow privilege escalation or governance
bypass.

This denylist is checked by create_document and update_field before
executing any mutation. The check is mandatory and cannot be overridden.
